Clone into the workspace that you use for labs/homeworks
Master Branch - Must always function, rare commits should only occur at group meetings
Develop Branch - Functioning Site with new features
Feature Branches - Where all code should begin, testing, implementation of your ideas
            E.X. feature/building-images should have functions written for adding images to the site
                  Will be merged with develop and then pushed to master when group decides it is ready
